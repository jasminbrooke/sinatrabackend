This Sinatra API serves my Build a Business application.
The API contains two models:
 - Users
 - Products
Both models utilize activerecord to perform validations and establish relationships 
The API provides routes for the following actions:
 - Full CRUD for Products
 - Create, Read, and Delete for Users
 - Login 

Build a Business is a single page application created using ruby, 
sinatra and react. 
Create your very own business planning organzier!
Users will be able to create a unique username, allowing them to log back in at any time.
Once logged in, users will be able to create products with details and pictures in the Create a Product sidebar. These details include, a name, an image, a category, a description, a cost and a sale price. The app will automatically calculate a profit using the cost and sale price. Once these products are created, they will appear in detailed cards to the side of the Create a Product form, including all submitted information. Some details will be hidden for a simplified look, but can be easily accessed by clicking on the down arrow on the bottom of the card. Products can be marked or unmarked as "Best Sellers" and/or "Available" at any time using the heart icon and price tag icon, respectively. Users will be able to edit, delete and filter products as needed. Products can be filtered by "Best Sellers" and "Available". Both filters can be removed with one click. Let Build a Business help you on your way to success!
